# Robotics with VEX Cortex - With Robot C IDE, C, C++, VEX Cortex and Beaglebone
* Robot C is used for direct communication between a VEX Cortex and the Agent (robot) - All C files must be uploaded directly to the cortex using Robot C IDE
* The Beaglebone uses a C++ application to communicate with the VEX Cortex (using a UART cable) - C++ application can be placed in a user defined directory to be called by the user
* A terminal emulator will be required to SSH into the Beaglebone (SSH guide not provided)

  This repository consists of three different projects that have been designed to give a VEX Agent (robot), using a VEX Cortex and Beaglebone, semi-autonomous control of its surroundings by utilizing different sensors and multiple motors. This allows the VEX agent to interact with its environment accordingly.

## Sensors and Motors Used
**Motor Type 393 Used**

**Sensor #1** - VEX Motor 393 Integrated Encoder Modules - used to control the wheel motors and ensure exact power adjustment

**Sensor #2** - VEX Line Trackers - used to find a line and travel along the line
  * Calibration for tracking can be found in the source code
  
**Sensor #3** - VEX Ultrasonic Range Finder - used to determine the distance between and object and the agent

**Sensor #4** - VEX Potentiometer - used to control the arm and ensure exact arm positioning


## Project 1  - Beaglebone not Used - [Project Directory](https://github.com/jpildush/Mobile-Robotics/tree/master/Project%201)
Project one is an obstacle course that utilizes 2 x Sensor #1. The course consists of a few turns which lead to the finsh line. This requires calculating different power outputs for the agent's motors and knowing the track length. 

### Designed Path Using Sensor #1 and Associated Motors
* Agent will move forward a few feet
* Agent will turn left 90 degrees
* Agent will move forward a couple feet
* Agent will turn left 90 degrees
* Agent will move forward a few feet
* Agent will turn right 90 degrees 
* Agent will move forward a couple feet and finish the obstacle

## Project 2  - Beaglebone not Used - [Project Directory](https://github.com/jpildush/Mobile-Robotics/tree/master/Project%202)
Project two is an obstacle course that utilizes 2 x Sensor #1, 5 x Sensor #2, 1 x Sensor #3 and 1 x Sensor #4.  The goal of this course is for the agent to find a water bottle and bring it to its proper destination. 
### Designed Path Using Sensor #1 to #4 and Associated Motors
 * Agent will move forward
 * Agent will find a start line (electric tape for me)
 * Agent will make a 90 degree turn to the left
 * Agent will adjust so that the agent is moving along the line and continues to move along the line
 * Agent will continue to move along the line until the agent tracks that the line has ended. 
 * Agent will commence scanning ahead for the bottle and move toward the bottle. 
 * Agent will open its claw and slowly move towards the bottle and stop when the bottle is inside of the claw.
 * Agent will turn 180 degrees and move forward for approximately 2 feet. 
 * Agent will turn 90 degrees to the left and move forward. 
 * Agent will stop in front of a set obstacle - indicating the drop off point - and fully stop. 
 * Agent will drop the bottle  - completing the obstacle course!

## Project 3  - Beaglebone Used - [Project Directory](https://github.com/jpildush/Mobile-Robotics/tree/master/Project%203)
Project three requires user input to control the Agent - custom built autonomous safety net method is designed to ensure safety of Agent regardless of what the user commands. The user must use a terminal emulator to connect to the Beaglebone, over the Beaglebone's LAN network. 
 
### Designed Path Using Sensor #1 to #4 and Associated Motors
 * There is no designed path for this project because the user has full control of the Agent. Safety net uses all sensors and will override a user command if Agent is in danger. 


## Demonstration of Operation
**Demonstration 1**
 * In the video it can be noticed that the arm has surpassed the acceptable arch point. Make sure to thoroughly test that Sensor #4 is operating properly, otherwise the Agent may get damaged
