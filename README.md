# Mobile Robotics - With Robot C, C++, VEX Cortex and Beaglebone
* Robot C is used for direct communication between a VEX Cortex and a Beaglebone (Bealgebone has been connected to the VEX Cortex through a UART cable)
* C++ is used to communicate from console (laptop) to the Beaglebone through the Beaglebone's LAN network

This reposoirty consists of four different projects that have been designed to give a VEX agent (robot), using a VEX Cortex, autonomous control of its surroundings by utilizing different sensors. This allows the VEX agent to interact with its environment accordingly.

## Sensors Used
1. VEX Potentiometer - used to control the arm and ensure exact arm positioning
2. VEX Ultrasonic Range Finder - used to determine the distance between and object and the agent
3. VEX Line Trackers - used to catch a line and travel along a line
4. VEX Integrated Encoder Modules - used to control the wheel motors and ensure exact power adjustment


## Project 1 - [Project Directory](https://github.com/jpildush/Mobile-Robotics/tree/master/Project%201)
Project one is an obstacle course that utilizes Sensor 4. The course consists of a few turns, leading to the finsh line. This requires calculating different power outputs for the agent and knowing the track length.
