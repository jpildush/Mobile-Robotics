# Mobile Robotics - Using Robot C for direct communication with the VEX Corted
This reposoirty consists of four different projects that have been designed to give a VEX robot (using a VEX Cortex) autonomous control of its surroundings by utilizing different sensors. This allows the VEX robot to interact with its environment accordingly.
